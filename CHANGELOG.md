# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Immutable paper-only debit-vertical opening and closing permits.
- Official Alpaca MCP request compilation with deterministic client-order identity.
- Submit-once readback reconciliation for ambiguous MCP responses.
- Cancel-or-close lifecycle handling with broker-backed event-position flatness receipts.

### Safety

- Paper execution is the only supported account mode.
- Filled spreads close as one reversed multi-leg order; partial fills never trigger sequential leg repair.
- Synthetic and indicative data remain ineligible for profitability or executable-fill claims.

### Changed

- Adopted Esscher as the public product name while retaining the `ringdown-market` distribution, `ringdown_market` import package, and `ringdown` CLI for compatibility.
- Retained the legacy report `project: "Ringdown"` value and added `product_name: "Esscher"` as an additive display alias.
- Documented the post-merge repository rename checklist and added a deterministic stale-public-brand check.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial point-in-time scheduled-earnings evaluation harness.
